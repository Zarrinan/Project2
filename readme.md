## Emotion

### your personal emotion track application

Emotion is an application designed to track emotions through selfies. A user is supposed
 to take selfies and upload them into application and in return will recieve a chart
 with emotions scores. Emotions detected in the application are happiness, sadness, anger,
 and fear. Also, user can leave comments to the results, or just write how their day was.
 Every time a user upload an image and adding record of the results, it is saved in the database. 
 So, at the end of a period a user can check which emotions prevailed.

 ## Features
 
 Initially, I planned to add:
 
 - picture upload and preview,
 
 - a user login,
 
 - data storage and manipulation (adding, editing, deleting, seeing the whole list or a specific entry);
 
 - graphical representation of data for each user and for all users;
 
 Due to challengies I did not foresee at the beginning, a graphical representation 
 is not included and user login also to be included after.
